Compilation instructions, running instructions and some results:

Compilation:

Compilation of the a) part is done with the makefile makeE3P3:

$ make -f makeE3P3 

Compilation of the b) part is done with the makefile makeE3P3b:

$ make -f makeE3P3b

Running:

Running is done by excecuting E3P3.exe for a) abd E3P3b.exe:

$ ./E3P3.exe 
$ ./E3P3b.exe

Results:

First I have to remark that the importance sampling whent horribly wrong,
I used function g(x) = x^(1/12)+1 as the smoothing function in order to reduce 
f(x)/g(x) into A*x^(2/3), where A was the normalization constant. Anyhow, here
are the results for a):

If I was pressed for computer time, I guess I woud use the stratied sampling,
it produced the most accurate result with all sample size and was at worst the 
second fastest routine.

For the b) part I calculated the average of the <f> terms and attempted to 
calculate the error of that average:

DS: <f> =  0.703433390 err = 22.233409899
SS: <f> =  0.703311181 err = 22.229529252
HM: <f> =  0.000000000 err =  0.000000000
PSS: <f> =  0.682299607 err = 21.565417281
IS: <f> =  4.395869870 err = 138.940139763

I wasn't expecting much from IS, but for all the others the error seems orders 
of magnitude too large!! I think I didn't understand the error calculation 
formula correctly...
