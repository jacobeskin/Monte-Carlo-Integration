Calculating the volume of a N-sphere with Monte Carlo integration using
hit-and-miss method in dimensions 1-15. Number of generated points is
50000000. Output is the volume and statistical error of the result.

Compilation instructions, running instructions and some results:

Compilation:

Compilation:
$ make -f makehitandmiss

Running:
$ ./hitandmiss.exe
  

Results:

The results look very good up to dimension 6, then the error starts to rise.
I first tried runs with 1000000 points and 50000000 points, the latter giving 
better results but still in higher dimensions not necessarily anything. I 
suppose that by doing the runs with high enough simulation points, one
would get something else than a null result for the highest dimensions. Here
is a result done with 50 000 000 generated points:
