Evaluating the volume of an N-dimensional hypersphere (radius 1) with
Monte Carlo integration using simple sampling. Integration is done for
dimension 1 to 15, and as an output the program prints the volume and
statistical error. Number of points generated for each integration is
50000000.

Compilation:
$ make -f makesimplesampling

Running:
$ ./simplesampling.exe

Results:

The volumes where calculated also by generating 50 000 000 points. The results
for lower dimension look pretty good, and the statistical error is quite small.
For higher dimensions the result starts drifting away from the exact value,
probably due to amount of points generated landing in the sphere. The 
dimension printed is actually the dimension of the function f, which means
that the volume is actually one dimension higher, unlike in the previous 
problem.

Comparing this to the hit&miss routine, we have to look at dimension 
differently (this is due to me writing the codes in that way partly by accident)
Lets compare the results (above dim 1->14, from H&M dim 2->15)

The statistical errors calculated where much smaller in the sampling method,
and the results diverge as the dimensionality rises.
